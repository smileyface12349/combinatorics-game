# combinatorics-game
A game to teach combinatorics.

You may compile the code to play the game. A release will be provided soon, once the game (in particular, the navigation) reaches a minimum standard.

Consists of a few topics:
* Bijections: Various problems asking you to draw lines to match up disparate problems to show that they count the same thing.
* Catalan Number Zone: Picks two random problems that count the Catalan numbers and asks for a bijection between them
* Planar Graphs: Presents a graph and asks for either a planar drawing or a proof that it is non-planar using the Kuratowski-Wagner theorem
* Graph Colouring: Planned
* An additional topic is planned, but this is not yet decided.

# License
This game is part of my third year project, and is still under active development. For this reason, the code is provided with no license meaning you may not use, distribute or modify this code beyond the ways permitted by law. From May 2025 (ish), the project will likely finish development and at this point it is likely that the code will be made open source. However, you may not use this code until the license has changed on this repo.
