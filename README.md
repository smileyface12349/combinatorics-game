# combinatorics-game
A game to teach combinatorics.

You may compile the code to play the game. A version is playable in the browser at https://joshhumphriss.com/games/combinopolis/.

Consists of a few topics:
* Bijections: Various problems asking you to draw lines to match up disparate problems to show that they count the same thing.
* Catalan Number Zone: Picks two random problems that count the Catalan numbers and asks for a bijection between them.
* Planar Graphs: Presents a graph and asks for either a planar drawing or a proof that it is non-planar using the Kuratowski-Wagner theorem.
* Graph Colouring: Find graph colourings, and establish bounds on the chromatic number.
